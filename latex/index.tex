This application was designed to demonstrate the use of sockets in I\+PC for assessment three part b of the dynamic data structures unit. A server will accept multiple clients, When a client connects they must first input their name and click send, this will initiate the connection. Once connected a client can enter text and click to send, this will be received on the server end and will be output within the server textbox with the users name displayed. If there are more than one client connected then that text will be output to other clients with the correct name displaying. Upon clicking the exit button a client will disconnect. Please note -\/ if you get a \char`\"{}cannot block a call on this socket while an earlier asynchronous call is in progress\char`\"{} error, or an System\+IO error when Key\+Down enter, just restart the program, it seems to happen randomly.
